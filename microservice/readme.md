# Paint the Moon microservice

The microservice uses the `actix_web` library for standard server-side logic and the [`multiversx interactor`](https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/meta/interactor/interactors-overview/) for SC interaction. 

## Try this example locally

In order to run the program, clone the repository and run it with `cargo run`.
Now, the 3 routes should be available on `localhost`:
```
#[GET] - localhost::8089/query - for SC query
#[POST] - localhost::8089/setup - for SC setup
```

There already is a contract address configured within the `state.toml` file.
However, if it is deleted, one can be generated by the setup endpoint.
